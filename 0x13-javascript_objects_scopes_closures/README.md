Tasks 0. Rectangle #0 mandatory

Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class

    Rectangle #1 mandatory

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

    Rectangle #2 mandatory

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

    Rectangle #3 mandatory

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

    Rectangle #4 mandatory

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

    Square #0 mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
The constructor must take 1 argument: size
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

    Square #1 mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
    If c is undefined, use the character X

    Occurrences mandatory

Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list:

Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)

Esrever mandatory

    Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list:

    Prototype: exports.esrever = function (list) You are not allow to use the built-in method reverse

    Log me mandatory

Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value. (see example below)

Prototype: exports.logMe = function (item)
Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>

    Number conversion mandatory

Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument:

Prototype: exports.converter = function (base)
You are not allowed to import any file
You are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc..)
